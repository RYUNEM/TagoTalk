# TagoTalk - A mesh-based communacation set-up for motorcycle riders with app integration
TagoTalk is an offline communication system designed specifically for motorcycle riders, particularly motorcycle clubs, to maintain seamless group coordination without relying on internet or cellular signal.

##ðŸš¦ Overview

TagoTalk combines Wi-Fi Direct / Mesh Networking and Bluetooth to create a reliable, low-latency communication platform for riders, ensuring connectivity even in remote areas.

Hotspot / Mesh Networking: Forms the backbone of the group communication network, enabling devices to interconnect and relay messages across riders.
